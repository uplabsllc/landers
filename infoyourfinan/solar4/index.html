          <p><strong><span style="font-family: 'open sans'; color: rgb(0,0,0); font-size: 16px;">When homeowners visit the Solar Program's Official Site, they may be surprised to find that a new policy in 2016 qualifies homeowners in specific zip codes to be eligible for $1000's of Government funding to <a href='http://track.solartimeisnow.info/click' target="_blank">install solar panels</a> at up to $0 down based on credit.</span></strong></p>
          <p class="open-sans">With many concerned about rising energy costs in 2016, more and more homeowners are shocked that subsidies and rebates cover 99% of costs associated with installation so it literally costs $0 to have done. In fact, in a matter of weeks you could already be reducing your power bill as well as your environmental footprint. So not only will you be saving thousands, you'll be saving the environment. Sound too good to be true?</p>
          <p class="open-sans">Meredith Miller, a Los Angeles based designer, took advantage of the limited time Solar Powering America program and saved 75% off of her electric bill.  She thanks @POTUS (President Obama's Twitter) after he mentions the program's success in this year's state of the union address. Other residents across the country are seeing the same exciting results if not better.</p>
          <h2><strong>So, How Does This Program Work?</strong></h2>
          <p class="open-sans">You no longer have to buy solar panels, the new policy let's you lease <a href='http://track.solartimeisnow.info/click' target="_blank">solar panels for $0 down</a>. Until now, solar panels cost $10's of thousands of dollars to purchase and install and unless you were building a new home or had that much extra cash sitting around, the cost was more than the benefit. The solar panels had to be purchased. It was impossible for companies to offer rent or lease agreements because they would lose money.</p>
          <p class="open-sans">Investor backed power companies have been caught off guard by people like Meredith who have slashed their electricity bills. The truth is pricing for solar panels has lowered drastically in the last 20 years, leaving solar panels affordable for consumers who could not afford to switch to solar power. Either way, one thing you can be sure of, however, is that your power company is not going to call you up to inform you of <a href='http://track.solartimeisnow.info/click' target="_blank">this exclusive program.</a></p>
          <p class="open-sans bg-success green-background"><strong>NOTE: You are not locked into your power company policy if you've already paid your current policy, you can very easily cancel and the balance will be refunded. <a href='http://track.solartimeisnow.info/click' target="_blank">See if you qualify >></a></strong></p>

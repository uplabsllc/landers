        <p>This is the 1 simple truth your power company doesnâ€™t want you to know. There is a new policy in 2016 that qualifies homeowners who live in specific zip codes in California to be eligible for thousands of dollars in government funding to install solar panels. Has your power company told you that?</p>
        <p>When homeowners from California check whether they qualify at <a id="zip" href="http://track.solartimeisnow.info/click" ><a href="http://track.solartimeisnow.info/click">SolarRebatesNow</a> </a>many are shocked that subsidies and rebates cover most of the costs associated with installation! With very little to $0 down, you could be on your way to significantly reducing your electric bill in a matter of weeks. </p>

        <br>

        <p><strong>So, how does this program work?</strong> You no longer have to buy solar panels, the new policy let's you lease <a>solar panels for as little as $0 down.</a> Until now, solar panels cost $10's of thousands of dollars to purchase and install and unless you were building a new home or had that much extra cash sitting around, the cost was more than the benefit. The solar panels had to be purchased. It was impossible for companies to offer rent or lease agreements because they would lose money.</p>

        <p>However this has all changed, and solar panels are now cheaper and more efficient than they have ever been, and with government programs covering the majority of the cost, sevices like <a href="http://track.solartimeisnow.info/click">SolarRebatesNow</a> are matching money-saving homeowners with solar panel subsidies in their area.</p>

        <h1>Does Donald Trump Want You To Go Solar?</h1>
        <h2>Trump's Statement Proven Wrong in 2015</h2>

        <p>Donald Trump was quoted in a 2012 interview with Fox News saying “Solar, as you know, hasn't caught on because, I mean, a solar panel takes 32 years — it's a 32-year payback. Who wants a 32-year payback? The fact is, the technology is not there yet.”</p>
        <p>Wow has time proven him wrong. To begin with, the average period for solar panels to become profitable is only a few years (though it depends on a number of factors), so that was wrong to begin with. But Solar has been on fire, and experts now claim that solar is about to reach ‘grid parity' with other sources of energy, and with recent government incentives <a class="link" href="http://track.taytayads.com/click">(see if you qualify here)</a> solar has proven ROI-positive for countless homeowners. Let's see why…</p>

        <h3>The cost of electricity has skyrocketed since 1969 with no end in sight</h3>
        <p>Energy prices have been steadily increasing for decades; it's a safe bet to say that trend will not abate any time soon</p>
        <ul>
          <li>History shows that electricity prices only go up over time because utility companies do not have any interest in or need to reduce prices, even when their costs are lower.</li>
          <li>Residential electricity prices in California have increased massively since the early 2000's, even adjusted for inflation, according to Energy Department statistics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Solar energy has never been cheaper</h3>
        <p>It is amazing how quickly solar energy prices have dropped in the last few years. Once the domain of the rich with money to burn, or extreme greenies, Solar has become a mainstream option that can save the planet while saving you money.</p>
        <p>With solar panel costs down 75% and efficiency up by half, solar energy is less expensive than it ever has been in history. With the government tax credit incentives – if you move fast, they may expire this year - this is the perfect time to get solar panels on your home. If you've been thinking about riding the solar wave, we may have just reached the perfect time, as solar energy has become a global industry that is expanding at a dizzying pace.</p>
        <p><a class="link" href="http://track.taytayads.com/click">Why continue to pay the utility companies a penny more than you have to?</a></p>
        <h3>Solar Energy Credits Expire Soon</h3>
        <p>The Energy Policy Act of 2005 has made solar especially affordable for homeowners in the last few years, but unfortunately many do not realize they are set to expire at the end of 2016. We'd recommend you look into taking advantage of these massive credits before they are gone.</p>
        <p>If your home meets the conditions, many solar providers such as SunRun offer zero-down loan offers monthly payments that are lower than your average electricity bill, allowing you to start saving money from the first day of installation on your home.</p>

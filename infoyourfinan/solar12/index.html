                <h1>The Solar Tax Credits Power Companies Do NOT Want You to Know About!</h1>
                <p class="bb text-muted">
                  How Government cash incentives of $5,689 have homeowners running to install solar panels
                </p>
               <img class="img-responsive" src="./opinion-solar_files/cover.jpg"><br>
              <p><strong>The government is paying people to go solar. If your zip code is in one of the lucky areas you could get as much as $1,000 in tax credits and rebates, just by installing solar panels on your roof.</strong></p>
              
              <p><a class="red-hover" href="http://track.solartimeisnow.info/click" target="_blank"><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0); font-size: 18px;">Check your Zip Code</span></a></p>

              <p>People who live in specific areas can qualify for Federal Residential Renewable Energy Tax Credit created to encourage as many people as possible to take up solar, helping the government meet their green energy targets.</p>
              
              <h3>How it works</h3>
              <p>The government realised some people were put off getting solar panels because of the price, so to make it more affordable they have brought in <a href="http://track.solartimeisnow.info/click" target="_blank">rebates, tax cuts and leasing schemes</a>, making it virtually free to install.</p>
              
              <p>For homeowners, it means you can lease solar panels for <a href="http://track.solartimeisnow.info/click" target="_blank">as little as $0 down</a>, and still get tax credits and rebates on top.</p>
              
              <h3>Act now, lock down the prices</h3>
              <p>For now, this scheme is being kept under wraps, probably because the government does not want to be seen to be reducing your bills and taking money from the big power companies. The tax break has been launched quietly with only some people working out just how much money they can save. If you act now, you can lock in this deal.</p>

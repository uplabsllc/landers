                  <strong>New policies are indicating that for years many drivers have likely overpaid on their car insurance.</strong>
               </p>

               <p>
                  This is the 1 simple truth your car insurance company doesn't want you to know. If you drive less than 50 miles/day and live in a qualified zip code you can get an extremely high discount. Additionally, if you have no DUI's, you can get even more discounts. But do you think your auto insurance company will tell you that?
               </p>

               <p>
                  <strong>So, what is the "One New Rule?"</strong> NEVER buy insurance without <a href="http://track.solartimeisnow.info/click" target="_blank">comparing all of the discounts online</a> first.
               </p>

               <p>
                  When drivers enter their zip code and driver information at <a href="http://track.solartimeisnow.info/click" target="_blank">TopAutoQuote™ official site</a> many are shocked at the results they find. Most just cannot believe that the available rates are in fact real, but the truth there was no easy way for them to compare quotes before.

                  <strong>For example</strong>, a hypothetical 40-year-old married male driver with a clean driving record is quoted at rates ranging from $1,045 to $3,048 for Stockdale, Texas, 78160. The typical price he would pay for auto insurance is $1,436, but he can find $391 or 27% in savings with the cheapest $1,045 premium.<sup>2</sup>

               <blockquote>
                  <strong>Note:</strong> You're NEVER LOCKED into your current policy. If you've already paid your current policy, you can very easily cancel and the balance will be refunded.

         <p>
            <strong>12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</strong> (The "Arbitration
            Clause"). In the event of a dispute, you and YourFinancialAssistant.com
            agree to submit to binding arbitration. The arbitration will be held
            before one arbitrator on an individual basis and not as a class
            action. You waive any right you may have to arbitrate a dispute as a
            class action. You may select any one of the following arbitration
            organizations and its applicable rules: the American Arbitration
            Association, 335 Madison Ave., Floor 10, New York, NY 10017-4605
            (www.adr.org) or JAMS, 1920 Main St., Ste. 300, Irvine, CA 92614
            (www.jamsadr.com). You may obtain copy of the rules of each
            organization by contacting the organization. Arbitrators shall be
            attorneys or retired judges and shall be selected pursuant to the
            applicable rules. The arbitrator shall apply governing substantive
            law in making an award. The arbitration hearing shall be conducted in
            the federal district in which you reside. Each party shall be
            responsible for its own attorney, expert and other fees, unless
            awarded by the arbitrator under applicable law. The arbitrator's
            award is final and binding on all parties, except that the losing
            party may request a new arbitration under the rules of the
            arbitration organization by a three-arbitrator panel. The Federal
            Arbitration Act, and not any state arbitration law, governs all
            arbitration under this Arbitration Clause. Any court having
            jurisdiction may enter judgment on the arbitrator's award. If any
            part of this Arbitration Clause, other than waivers of class action
            rights, is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason, the
            remainder remains enforceable. You and YourFinancialAssistant.com retain the
            right to sue in small claims court for a dispute within that court's
            jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed
            to a different court. You and YourFinancialAssistant.com do not waive the right
            to arbitrate by filing suit.
         </p>
         <p>THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND
            YourFinancialAssistant.com WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION AND NOT IN
            COURT OR BY JURY TRIAL. IF A DISPUTE IS ARBITRATED, YOU GIVE UP YOUR
            RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY
            CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST YourFinancialAssistant.com INCLUDING ANY RIGHT
            TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS.
            WITHOUT LIMITATION, THIS INCLUDES GIVING UP YOUR RIGHTS TO BRING OR
            PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>13. GENERAL. </strong>The Agreement comprises the entire
            agreement between you and YourFinancialAssistant.com and supersedes all prior
            agreements regarding the subject matter contained herein, provided,
            however, that in the case of Users who are sellers and who have
            entered into separate agreements ("Seller Agreements") with
            YourFinancialAssistant.com related to the display of advertising materials
            related to their products or services or their availability, the
            obligations of the parties related to the Services shall be
            controlled by the terms of such Seller Agreements in the event of any
            inconsistency between such Seller Agreements and the Agreement.
            YourFinancialAssistant.com may amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement
            (the "Amended Terms") from time to time. If you continue to
            use the Service after the Amended Terms become effective, you are
            deemed to have agreed to be bound by the Amended Terms. If you do not
            agree to the Amended Terms, then you agree not to use the Service.
